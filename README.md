# weather-monitor
A weather monitor and trend analyser

The idea is to have an application gathering weather data for user specified locations (coordinates) and show a nice looking, period adjustable, dashboard with weather trends.

Could also be made as a terminal app.

This came up to have an idea what are the predominat winds in a given location (to choose the best orientation for a runway).
